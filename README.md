This project involves creating a mobile application based on a provided UI mockup. The application includes a login screen where users input their name and email, which are then displayed on the home screen. The home screen features sections for popular and featured job cards, each displaying at least 8 cards. The job cards are designed as functional components that accept props for card details, rendering job information like job title, company name, and description. The application is styled to match the UI design closely, using custom components throughout for consistency and reusability. Each development task is committed separately for clear tracking. For submission, delete the node_modules directory, compress the repository, and submit it to Sakai. Access the UI design and resources from the provided Figma file, and include screenshots of the login screen, home screen, and job sections in the README.
