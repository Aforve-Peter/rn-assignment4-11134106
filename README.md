This project involves creating a mobile application based on a provided UI mockup. The application includes a login screen where users input their name and email, which are then displayed on the home screen. The home screen features sections for popular and featured job cards, each displaying at least 8 cards. The job cards are designed as functional components that accept props for card details, rendering job information like job title, company name, and description.
